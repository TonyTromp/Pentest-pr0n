NOTE: UserAssist has multiple GUID entries. Each entry symbolizes a Type of file beeing executed.
{BFFXXXX} means executables. 
Data relies under Count are best viewed using a better RegistryViewer such as: RegistryExplorer (which also decodes some values).

AMCache What is Run when its run
* First Time of Execution
* amcacheparser.py
* sha-1 of file
```
* XP: SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SessionManager\AppCompatibility\AppCompatCache
* Server 2003-2016 / Win7-10: SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SessionManager\AppCompatCache\AppCompatCache

NOTE: AMCACHE DOES NOT TRACK LAST EXECUTION! ONLY when the underlying code has been changed and amount of times its beeing run.

Link files:
C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Recent


Profiles:
C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\Local => Local stored apps
C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\LocalLow => Apps with lower priviledges (containerisation)
C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\Roaming => Syncronizes with AD on logging off. So when user deletes his drive/files while working offline, it will be still be on the Domain Controller


Recent Files=>Creation Time is same as Execution Time. Date Modified every subquent time started.
On Windws 8 and Lower

LNK files contain information about the target and the LNK Recent when the file has been accessed. It also stores a lot of additional attributes such as: MediaType, MAC address of target.
Caveat with LNK files is that it ommits the extension. So files with different extensions BUT who have 


Tracking Folders (Accessed) with ShellBags (Explorer Folder Preferences.. such as sorting).
NOTE: Caveat will also list folders that the user TRIED to access but Access Is Denied.
The event will also occur when the icon is hightlighted (focus). When selecting all ONLY the first one gets focus.
Only the MOST RECENT time that got highlighted/focused.

~30 days after drive has been removed all drivers and data will be removed

USBSTO
You can tell when its first plugged in
You can tell when its last plugged in
When its safely removed
Using this we can subtract lastplugin time with first plugin time and we have the total time the USB device was plugged in.
